Planets: Our Demonlord is hungry for some planets and their inhabitants souls,
	but they won't go without a fight.
	Planets are armed with a giant laser that can destroy your cover (and you).
	
Moons: This galaxy is not new to colonizing their moons,
	they even armed them with giant (less powerful) lasers.
	They cannot destroy your cover, but don't underestimate their numbers.

When a Planet or Moon is DEMONISHED, you can use the resulting pieces as ammunition to keep your DEMONITION.

Ships: The Intergalactic Council has become aware of your DEMONITION,
	so they've sent their fleets of ships to stop you.
	They will sneak attack you from behind and they're too fast to DEMONISH,
	so stay alert to avoid their attempts.

Asteroids: They exist. You can use them for your DEMONITION.
